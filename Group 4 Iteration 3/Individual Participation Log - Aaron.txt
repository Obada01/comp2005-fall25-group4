For iteration 4, I, Aaron Power:
- Reworked the entire codebase
- Completed all remaining code, including endgame logic, CPU logic, color blindness settings, frog collision logic, and so much more I cannot even begin to think of.

Please note that for whatever reason, my alternate GitHub account labeled "Supaku35" made these commits despite my numerous attempts to stop GitHub from doing this.
